# Flutter MVVM App Architecture

This project implements the application architecture guidelines described in Flutter's official architecture case study. It follows an MVVM-based UI layer combined with repositories and services in the data layer to create a scalable, maintainable Flutter application structure.

This repository is intended for learning, architectural reference, and portfolio demonstration purposes.

---

## Architecture Overview

This project follows the architectural principles outlined in Flutter's App Architecture Case Study:

- MVVM pattern in the UI layer
- ChangeNotifier / Listenable-based state management
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for API and external communication
- Dependency Injection using Provider
- Clear separation of concerns across layers

The architecture separates responsibilities into distinct layers:

### UI Layer (Feature-Based)
- Views (Screens & Widgets)
- ViewModels (ChangeNotifier)
- Feature-specific organization

### Domain Layer
- Pure data models
- Business entities shared across layers
- No Flutter dependencies

### Data Layer
- Repositories (coordinate data flow)
- Services (API / local storage communication)
- API models if needed

> Test structure mirrors `lib/` to maintain clear separation of unit and widget tests.

- Scalable project structure for large applications

---

## Tech Stack

- Flutter
- Dart
- Provider (Dependency Injection & State)
- ChangeNotifier / Listenable
- Repository Pattern
- MVVM Architectural Pattern

## Purpose

This project serves as:

- A reference implementation of Flutter's recommended architectural guidelines
- A template for building scalable Flutter applications
- A portfolio demonstration of architectural understanding

It is not a full production application, but the structure is production-ready and designed for extensibility.
